Microeconomics I is the first subject of the training cycle in Economic
Theory. Its importance and, at the same time, complexity arises from the fact that it is the
first time the student becomes familiar with current economic models. Over the course
the student will learn to formalize economic phenomena and gain an understanding of
their workings. The course covers the basic economic models of consumer theory,
production theory, and partial equilibrium.
